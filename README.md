# OpenWeatherApp

OpenWeatherApp - Simple Weather App
OpenWeatherApp is a mobile application developed for iOS devices that provides users with real-time weather information based on their current location or a specific city name search. The app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to ensure a well-structured and modular codebase.

## Key Features
 - Current Location Weather: The app utilizes the device's GPS capabilities to determine the user's current location. It fetches the corresponding weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the current temperature and "feels like" temperature.
 - City Name Search: Users can enter a city name in the search feature to retrieve the current weather information for that specific location. The app communicates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data for the searched city.
 - Weather Data Display: OpenWeatherApp provides a visually appealing and intuitive interface to present the weather information. It displays the current temperature, "feels like" temperature, and an image representation of the weather conditions, such as clouds or sun.
 - OpenWeatherMap API Integration: The app integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data. It utilizes the API's endpoints to retrieve weather information based on location or city name search.
 - User-Friendly Interface: OpenWeatherApp offers a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation and clear presentation of weather data. Users can quickly access the current temperature and "feels like" temperature for their location or any searched city.
 - Model-View-Controller Architecture: The project follows the MVC architectural pattern. The model layer manages the weather data, including fetching data from the API. The view layer handles the visual representation of weather information, including temperature and weather condition images. The controller layer acts as the intermediary, handling user interactions and coordinating data between the model and the view.
